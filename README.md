# [pyDNMFk: Python Distributed Non Negative Matrix Factorization with determination of hidden features](https://github.com/lanl/pyDNMFk)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/lanl/pyDNMFk/actions/workflows/ci_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/lanl/Distributed_pyNMFk/actions/workflows/ci_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg) [![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.7.1-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.7.1-blue)





[pyDNMFk](https://github.com/lanl/pyDNMFk) is a software package for applying non-negative matrix factorization in a distrubuted fashion to large datasets. It has the ability to minimize the difference between reconstructed data and the original data through various norms (Frobenious, KL-divergence).  Additionally, the Custom Clustering algorithm allows for automated determination for the number of Latent features 

<hr/>

## Features:

* Utilization of MPI4py for distributed operation.
* Distributed NNSVD and SVD initiaizations.
* Distributed Custom Clustering algorithm for estimating automated latent feature number (k) determination.
* Objective of minimization of KL divergence/Frobenius norm. 
* Optimization with multiplicative updates, BCD, and HALS. 

## Installation:

python setup.py install
```

## Prerequisites:
* conda

* h5py

## Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https://lanl.github.io/pyDNMFk/). 


## Usage
We provide a sample dataset that can be used for estimation of k using 4 MPI Ranks:
```python
'''Imports block'''

import sys
import pyDNMFk.config as config
config.init(0)
from pyDNMFk.pyDNMFk import *
from pyDNMFk.data_io import *
from pyDNMFk.dist_comm import *
from scipy.io import loadmat
from mpi4py import MPI
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
args = parse()  


'''parameters initialization block'''


# Data Read here
args.fpath = 'data/'
args.fname = 'wtsi'  
args.ftype = 'mat'
args.precision = np.float32

#Distributed Comm config block
p_r, p_c = 4, 1  

#NMF config block
args.norm = 'kl'
args.method = 'mu'
args.init = 'nnsvd'
args.itr = 5000
args.verbose = True

#Cluster config block
args.start_k = 2 
args.end_k = 5
args.sill_thr = 0.9

#Data Write
args.results_path = 'results/'


'''Parameters prep block'''


comms = MPI_comm(comm, p_r, p_c)
comm1 = comms.comm
rank = comm.rank
size = comm.size
args.size, args.rank, args.comm, args.p_r, args.p_c = size, rank, comms, p_r, p_c
args.row_comm, args.col_comm, args.comm1 = comms.cart_1d_row(), comms.cart_1d_column(), comm1
A_ij = data_read(args).read().astype(args.precision)

nopt = PyNMFk(A_ij, factors=None, params=args).fit()
print('Estimated k with NMFk is ',nopt)
```
